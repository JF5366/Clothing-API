## Technologies
Built with React, Redux, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: `git clone <JF5366/Clothing-API>`
- Installation:  `npm install`   
- To Start Server:  `npm start`  
- To Visit App:  `http://localhost:3000/` 

## Approach

This was a one week project during my second module on React with Per Scholas Computer Engineering bootcamp. I used the ASOS API to source data for clothing products to recreate an ecommerce clothing store. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-dom` and `redux`.  

Main challenges included API authentication, properly setting up react redux toolkit and local storage to store and retrieve product data for the shopping cart and wishlist. 

## Future Developments

- Add more images and details to each product page
- Increment and devcrement item quantity 
- Develop search page to build an outfit based on search parameters
- Login
